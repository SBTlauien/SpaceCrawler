This is an Android Web Crawler that currently allows you to whitelist/blacklist/flag specific strings, within the URLs it crawls.

Upon first running the app, it will create a directory within the Internal Storage names "SpaceCrawler".  That directory will contain four files, "WhiteList.txt", "BlackList.txt", "WatchList.txt", and "Results.txt".  All four of these files can be viewed and edited within the "Options" section of the app.  Each line of these files represents a string that is either blacklisted/whitelisted/watchedFor/Found.
